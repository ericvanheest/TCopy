- "paste" mode - Copy list of files (vs. directories) not working during GetFiles()
- Copy hook
- test exceptions again with multithread
- threaded uses up a ton of CPU
- Save "overwrite?" queries until rest of copy is finished
- retest everything with multiple directories
  - read errors
  - write errors
  - pause/resume
  - md5 verify


Bugs:

- Double destination didn't make the second MD5 check on separate drives (?)
- Need to verify before overwriting MD5/SHA files

"TCopy -u -M to.md5 -s ." doesn't work
-u causes errors when it gets to "from.md5"

X TCopy -u says 0/total even if some % of the items have been skipped

Tcopy --paste --md5 with dirs that exist in the target confuse the MD5
TCopy --recover - use temporary file for info/dir list
TCopy - verify needs to flush the SD card or external drive somehow

TCopy dir1 dir2 will copy all files from dir1 onto file "dir2" if dir2 doesn't exist
